<h2>Notes</h2>
<p>
This won't work on Internet Explorer. Sorry about that! If you don't have another browser you can use, I'd happily add support.
<p>
If this runs too slowly for you, try changing the resolution factor in the menu below. It makes things grainier, but it should be a bit faster. Gives it that VHS charm.
<p>
This was partially an excuse to play around with generative graphics. The large snowflakes in the front are generated from random numbers, using a triangulation algorithm and minimum spanning tree stuff. It's not great code, but feel free to poke around at it; I'll try to document and organize it better if I get a chance.
<p>
The only JavaScript library used here was <a href="http://www.pixijs.com">PIXI.js</a>, to efficiently render the scene. It's incredible.
