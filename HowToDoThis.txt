So, pick random verticies in unit triangle, scale triangle
Since there aren't many, and we know the size, Bowyerâ€“Watson seems ideal.
    See https://github.com/jmespadero/pyDelaunay2D
Once done, add appropriate number of side edges and optional center edge
Now, render, with appropriate line styles, inner outer widths, etc
Oversampling for tumble and fall rotations? Use pixi2d or similar to allow
    for 3d texture acceleration?
Could be fun to have a nice little hoverable display of each unique flake

Over time, build snow pile in background. Simple buckets and splines?
    Or some other form of noise generation?
    Maybe... 2D perlin noise times a multiple, plus an offset, to generate
    taller hills and more variance over time, with a maximum multiple and
    offset over time?
As tree covered, light glow gets larger and more hidden.
Some way to blow away the snow, or a cycle of some sort?
Additional strings of lights?
Deer wandering over snowpile depending on spline? Other critters?
Some foreground elements should build up piles of snow on top

OK, OK, there are a bunch of birds who flutter around near the middle, and a cat who is occassionally there. The birds will start pecking at things, looking around etc. The cat will get close, and wait for one bird to get close. As the cat waits, snow will fall on it, piling up, until the cat leaps, scattering snow, and the birds flap off in random directions. The cat walks off dissapointed. This repeats, with different wait times.
